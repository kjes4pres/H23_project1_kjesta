### Comments
- In my test file, test_pendulum.py, I decided to set my tolerance as 1e-2. I know this is too big, but I didnt know what precision I should have for the analytical derivatives, and with only two decimals, this was the only way I could make it make sense. (test_rhs)

- I am quite unsure about the usage of doc strings. Both how extensive they should be and when to implement it. Would be grateful to get some feedback on that!

- I am familiar with Latex, but even when following the hint in exercise 2b I only got error messages when trying to implement latex in the labels of the plot. I hace checked that I have latex installed and have the newest version of matplotlib as well. 

- To answer the question in task 2h: the energy is now "lost" over time, and does not stay conserved. In a realistic model, perhaps due to friction. 

- I am aware that my last plot, energy_double.png, is not identical to the one given as example. I have been staring at my implementation of the equations of motion for quite some time, and cant seem to find where I went wrong..
